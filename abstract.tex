The emergence of Cloud Computing and Virtualization presented new opportunities in terms of flexibility and services abstraction. In networking, the abstraction of services has been mainly shown through improving the networks programmability (SDN) and decreasing the dependence between networking fucntions (DNS, NAT,...) and the specific hardware they turn upon (NFV). Service Function Chains (SFC) is a main breakthrough of services abstraction in networking. It presents networking services as an ordered set of basic networking functions, hence the increased flexibility. Nevertheless, such architecture would require improving the security aspect in order to ensure the network functions as expected. In this work, we look into Blockchain, the technology laying behind the famous digital currency Bitcoin, and its potential impact on improving such networks' security.     \\[0.5cm]
