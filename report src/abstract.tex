The emergence of Cloud Computing and Virtualization presented new opportunities in terms of flexibility and services abstraction. In networking, the abstraction of services has been mainly shown through improving the networks programmability (SDN) and decreasing the dependence between networking functions (DNS, NAT,...) and the specific hardware they turn upon (NFV). Service Function Chains (SFC) is a main breakthrough of services abstraction in networking. It presents networking services as an ordered set of basic networking functions, hence the increased flexibility. Nevertheless, such architecture would require improving the security aspect in order to ensure the network functions are wroking as expected. In this work, we look into Blockchain, the technology laying behind the famous digital currency Bitcoin, and its potential impact on improving SFC security. Firstly, we define the Service Function Chains and explain the different concepts related to them, then we analyse the various security aspects that can be improved in these networking architectures. As we consider mainly a blockchain-based solution for SFC security, we benchmark many blockchain solutions for this use case, which allows us, eventually, to choose Bitcoin's Blockchain as the most convenient solution for our probelm space.    \\[0.5cm]
